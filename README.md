# Self-driving-Car-Neural-Network

A self-driving car using neural networks in Python 3.6 and [pygame](https://www.pygame.org).

run it with:
```
>   pip install pygame

>   py -3.6 car.py
```

The car casts 5 rays in a cone in front of itself.
Each frame per ray, the distance to a wall is calculated.
This distance is fed into the network (2 layers each 10 nodes by default) which classifies if the car needs to (steer left, steer right, don't steer) and if the car needs to (brake, accelerate, neither).

The network is trained based on me playing the game for 5 minutes on a simple level (see image 2.png).
After training the car is able to easily complete a much more difficult level (see image 1.png).


# You can draw a level yourself!

Just make a 1024x720 image and draw away! The car will see any black pixel (RGB = 0,0,0) as a wall and try to avoid it.

It works best to create a circuit type of level, the car may have trouble in wide open areas if it cannot detect any walls.

The car currently spawns at (700, 100), where the top left corner is the origin, facing east. You can change that either in the file map1 (format shortly described below) or by setting the `leveleditor` flag to True and the `neural` flag to False in the `car.py` file. Now you can drive the car around yourself using the arrow keys. When you close the game the position of the car will be saved and be used the next times when you run the program. (Dont forget to reset the flags afterwards)

If you do make a level, please share it with me. I'd love to see what you can create!

* Code:
  * car.py: High-level gameloop & I/O
  * classes.py: Low-level implementation
  * utils.py: General helper functions & File I/O
* Data:
  * map1: legacy level data. Currently stores the position of the car and the background image for the level (where map_1.png corresponds to loading image `1.png`, map_xxx.png would correspond to loading xxx.png). 
  * tdata.in: ~5 minutes of the ray distances
  * tdata.out: ~5 minutes of users reaction to those states
